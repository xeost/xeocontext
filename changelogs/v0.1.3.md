# Changelog

## [0.1.2] - 2025-12-29

### Added
- **System Design Viewer**:
  - Added support for nested navigation items in the sidebar.
  - Implemented recursive rendering for complex navigation structures.
  - Added dynamic document `title` and `description` updates based on Markdown frontmatter for better SEO.
- **AsyncAPI Support**:
  - Enabled dereferencing of AsyncAPI schemas from external URLs using `$RefParser`.
- **Configuration**:
  - Introduced `XEOCONTEXT_CONTENT_DIR` environment variable to allow configuring the content directory path (defaults to `@/content`).
  - This allows for easier switching between different content sets during development.
- **Deployment**:
  - Added a GitHub Actions workflow to publish Docker images.

### Changed
- **Serverless Support**:
  - Refactored content fetching to support serverless environments (e.g., Cloudflare Workers, Vercel) where direct file system access is restricted.
  - Removed OpenNext integration to simplify the architecture and rely on Next.js standalone output.
  - Implemented an HTTP fallback mechanism to fetch content via API when local `fs` access is unavailable.
- **Dependencies**:
  - Updated project dependencies to their latest versions.

### Fixed
- **System Design Viewer**:
  - Resolved a race condition where the "On this Page" (Table of Contents) active item highlighting would fail to attach on page reload.
  - Fixed navigation path normalization ensuring reliable linking to nested documentation pages.
