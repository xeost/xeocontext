# v0.1.0 - Initial Release

Date: 2025-12-18

This is the initial unstable release of **XeoContext**, a unified viewer for System Design documentation, OpenAPI specifications, and AsyncAPI definitions.

## 🚀 Features

### Core Viewers
- **System Design Viewer**: Renders Markdown documents with built-in support for:
  - GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM).
  - Mermaid.js diagrams (Flowcharts, Sequence diagrams, C4, etc.).
  - Syntax highlighting for code blocks.
  - Auto-generated Table of Contents.
- **OpenAPI Viewer**:
  - Interactive REST API documentation using a custom implementation of **Swagger UI**.
  - **Dark Mode Support**: Fully customized theme that adapts to the application's dark mode, including high-contrast text and visible icons.
  - **Server-Side Dereferencing**: Resolves all `$ref` pointers (internal and external) on the server to ensure stability and performance in the client.
- **AsyncAPI Viewer**:
  - Event-Driven Architecture visualization using the AsyncAPI React component.
  - **Dark Mode Support**: Custom CSS filters and overrides to match the system theme.

### Infrastructure & Deployment
- **Docker Ready**:
  - Multi-stage `Dockerfile` for optimized production builds (Standalone mode).
  - `Dockerfile.dev` for live-reload development experience.
  - `docker-compose.yml` examples for mounting local content volumes.
- **Content-Driven**: designed to load configuration and documentation from a mounted `/content` directory at runtime.

### Validation & Developer Experience
- **Linting Tools**: Integrated documentation for validating specs using `redocly` (OpenAPI) and `asyncapi-cli`.
- **Example Content**: Included comprehensive example structures for DDD (Domain-Driven Design) projects.

## 🐛 Fixes & Improvements

- **OpenAPI Stability**:
  - Replaced `swagger-ui-react` with `swagger-ui-dist` to resolve critical compatibility issues ("refract is not a function") with Next.js 16 and Turbopack.
  - Implemented manual `SwaggerUIBundle` initialization to isolate the library from the React build process.
- **Specification Compliance**:
  - Fixed validataion errors in the example `openapi.yaml` (missing operationIds, security schemes, and server definitions).
- **Theme Consistency**:
  - Resolved contrast issues in dark mode for Swagger UI parameters and descriptions.
  - Fixed invisible icons in Swagger UI when in dark mode.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 16 (App Router)
- **Bundler**: Turbopack
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + generic CSS overrides
- **Parsers**: `@apidevtools/swagger-parser`
