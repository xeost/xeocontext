## [v0.1.4] - 2025-12-30

### Added

- **Customization & Deployment Scripts**: Introduced new scripts to streamline the process of customizing XeoContext with external content and deploying it to personal repositories.
    - `scripts/setup-content.ts`: A script that handles content synchronization (from local directories or Git repositories), updates the application code to a specific upstream tag, and configures Git remotes (`upstream` and `origin`) for deployment.
    - `scripts/list-releases.ts`: A utility script to fetch and list available release tags from the upstream repository.
- **NPM Commands**: Added new commands to `package.json`:
    - `pnpm setup-content`: Runs the content setup and deployment configuration script.
    - `pnpm list-releases`: Lists available XeoContext versions.
- **Configuration**: Added new environment variables to `.env.example` to support increased customization:
    - `XEOCONTEXT_CONTENT_TYPE` & `XEOCONTEXT_CONTENT_SOURCE`: To define where the system design content comes from.
    - `XEOCONTEXT_TAG`: To pin the application to a specific version of the XeoContext engine.
    - `XEOCONTEXT_DEPLOY_REPO`: To configure the target repository for deployment.
- **Documentation**: Updated `README.md` with a comprehensive "Customization & Deployment" guide.

### Changed

- **Dev Dependencies**: Added `tsx` to support the execution of the new TypeScript scripts.
